# Frontend-Backend Integration with JavaScript (EJS, Axios)
This repository contains a simple web application demonstrating the integration of frontend and backend using JavaScript. The frontend is built with EJS for dynamic HTML rendering, and Axios is used for making HTTP requests to the backend API. The application allows users to perform CRUD operations on a collection of books.

## Introduction
This project showcases how to build a web application where the frontend interacts with a backend server to perform CRUD operations on a collection of books. The integration is achieved using EJS for rendering dynamic UI elements and Axios for making asynchronous requests to the backend API.

### Features
-  View Books:
    - Display a list of books retrieved from the backend.
-  Add a Book:
    - Dynamically update the UI to add a new book.
-  Edit Book Details:
    - Allow users to modify book information and see the changes immediately.
-  Delete a Book:
    - Remove a book from the UI and the backend.

### Dependencies
-  Express.js: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
-  EJS: Embedded JavaScript templating.
-   Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.
